See `www/static/dist` for app artifacts

FontAwesome free icons downloaded from github, see [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases). The entire download is ~30MB extracted, therefore don't use npm to install. To keep things lean, only the [Web Fonts](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/host-yourself/webfonts) are versioned in this repo. For usage see [official docs](https://fontawesome.com/docs) and [quick reference documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome5_intro.asp)
