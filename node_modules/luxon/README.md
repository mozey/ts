# luxon

*"A powerful, modern, and friendly wrapper for JavaScript dates and times."*

**NOTE** This dependency was not installed with NPM.

## Usage

See `import 'luxon/luxon.js'` line in `src/app.ts`, this makes `esbuild` bundle the source code.

The `import { DateTime } from "luxon"` in `src/datepicker` makes use of the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) type definitions that were installed like this
```bash
npm install -D @types/luxon
```

## Why

Example of "vendor-ing" ES module dependencies, contained in a single file, in the repo, without depending on [npm](https://npmjs.com) 

Also, doing it this way adds a couple of hundred kilobytes to the repo size, instead of doing `npm install -S luxon` which add several megabytes.

## Updating

-  Download latest ES6 module from [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/install?id=es6), and save it to `node_modules/luxon/luxon.js`
- Update version number in `node_modules/luxon/package.json`, see [release tags](https://github.com/moment/luxon/tags)
