# luxon

*"A powerful, modern, and friendly wrapper for JavaScript dates and times."*

**NOTE** This dependency was not installed with NPM.

## Usage

See `import 'luxon/luxon.js'` line in `src/app.ts`, this makes `esbuild` bundle the source code.

The `import { DateTime } from "luxon"` in `src/datepicker` makes use of the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) type definitions in `@types/luxon`

## Why

Example of vendor-ing ES6 module dependencies container in a single file.

Does not depend on `npmjs.com`  

Also, doing it this way adds a couple of hundred kilobytes to the repo size, instead of the `npm install -D luxon` which uses up several megabytes.

## Updating

-  Download latest ES6 module from [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/install?id=es6), and save it to `node_modules/luxon/luxon.js`
- Update version number in `node_modules/luxon/package.json`, see [release tags](https://github.com/moment/luxon/tags)
