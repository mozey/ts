This is just a generic example of search API response.

Apps might use services like [algolia](https://www.algolia.com/),
or [Open Distro](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/)

For smaller (or partitioned) inventory,
search can also be implemented in javascript
with [Elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/)
